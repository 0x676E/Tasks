This algorithm checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

Explanation of how the algorithm works:

    Cleaning the Input String:
        First, we clean the input string by removing all non-alphanumeric characters and converting all letters to lowercase. This step ensures that we only consider the alphanumeric characters for palindrome checking and ignore case sensitivity.

    Recursive Approach:
        The core of the algorithm is a recursive function that compares characters from both ends of the string towards the center.
        At each step of the recursion, we compare the characters at the current positions of the left and right pointers.
        If the characters match, we recursively move the pointers inward and continue the comparison.
        If the characters don't match, we immediately return false, indicating that the string is not a palindrome.

    Base Case:
        The recursion stops when the left pointer becomes greater than or equal to the right pointer.
        This condition indicates that we have either reached the middle character (in case of odd-length strings) or crossed it (in case of even-length strings).
        If all characters have been compared and matched, we return true, indicating that the string is a palindrome.

    Overall Efficiency:
        The algorithm is efficient in terms of time and space complexity because it operates directly on the input string without creating additional copies or data structures.
        Additionally, the use of recursion allows for a concise and elegant solution to the palindrome-checking problem.
